123456789,440237556,4,so I LOVED this book till i got the end. Is my book missing pages or did it really just end with Chloe entering his apartment. Where is Dageus? Do they get a happy ending? is there a sequel to their story?
33445555,373272839,5,This was an awesome little read that took me all of about 3 hours to finish and gave me everything I could possibly want in a romance.
999887777,471200247,3,"The best thing about this book is that it is the book on dimensional data modeling, and it is written by the people who invented the approach in the first place."
987654321,743244249,2,Maybe Cosmopolis is very clever; if it is it's way too clever for me. I did stick with it (it's only a short tale) in the hope all would become clear. It never really did.
666884444,1558605525,1,"This is an excellent, but somewhat uneven, introduction to the field of machine learning"
453453453,60958332,3,"I had The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language out of the library for the entire summer. I finally finished it by actively reading it on the train for a couple of weeks. It's interesting, don't get me wrong, it's just LONG and has enough dull/confusing stretches that I couldn't bring myself to read it in my free time - it was pretty much a train-only book."
987987987,393318486,2,"The book does not lack good qualities, but I generally dislike the technique of argumentation that is too often characterized by poor proof backed by a certain arrogance towards alternative explanations"
888665555,60502935,5,"Every time I reread this book, I fall in love with it even more."
888866666,61092177,5,"This was the first Pratchett book I read, and I'm glad of it. While it has the humor and satire that is inherent in all of the Discworld books, it also has something else - something to say. It was evident, even from the first time I read this book, that Pratchett had put some real heavy thinking into it."
565656565,399149848,5,"This is another one of my favorite Nora Roberts books, which I say about most of the books of hers that I review. But with her having written so many, it makes sense to have a lot of favorites. Regardless, this is a favorite, though I know more than a few fans didn't care for this one."
123123123,385494149,1,Enduring Love is either a brilliant camp comedy or one of the worst attempts at serious fiction ever.
909090909,385494327,4,"I don't understand how anyone could dislike this. It's basically a novel about ideologies and philosophies and how they apply to human beings, not about them in general, and McEwan's prose is so precise and fabulous that reading this whole thing, a book where barely anything actually happens except for near the end, was incredibly involving and fascinating."
918918918,316666343,1,"Haaaaaated it. I am one of those OCD literary nerds who takes on a war bunker mentality with books that I've started and dislike: ""I will see this through to the end."""
,,,"For ""The Lovely Bones,"" I made an exception."
,,,"Somewhere, sometime, someone told Sebold she could write. That person should be made to apologize to me, in person, and to all other poor souls who were duped into buying this shlock."
567567567,446606812,5,"For those of you (like me) who have seen the movie of the same name starring Kevin Costner, the end of this novel will come as no surprise. I knew what I was getting in for when I started this book and kept the tissues well-stocked. In fact, I had to stop reading it on the bus for fear of crying in public."
647392954,446676098,1,"I love the movie, but if you think that was sappy, do not pick up this book. I heard Nicholas Sparks had a knack for sap, but I almost drowned in it and felt no spark at all. The book was so frustratingly simple and obvious and laid out."
758463729,446608955,4,I am surprised by how much I liked this one. This was my first Nicholas Sparks read and after years of it being recommended to me I finally gave in.
987032647,60540753,4,"Ann Patchett�s debut novel, The Patron Saint of Liars, is a beautifully written story about people, secrets, and lies. The book�s title intrigued me; �Patron Saint of Liars� � a conflict between virtue and dishonesty. Patchett�s writing is quiet and compelling as she shares the story of Rose Clinton, and how her lies affected her life and the lives of those around her"
101010101,156006219,3,"I enjoyed reading the book, but after reading it I couldn't say that I loved it (hence, three stars)."
676767676,375703764,5,"So there's a definite cult around this book, and I am one of the many who drank the Kool-Aide and never looked back."
645645645,743467523,1,"I know I am in the minority again. I did not like this one at all. Not only that, but I hate when a good horror book turns into science fiction and throws aliens at me. If I wanted aliens, I would go read Aliens (shout out to Ripley and Jones)."
