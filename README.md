# Extra-Credit

DESCRIPTION
Features two graphs and simple user interface obtained from our Books database. These graphs were obtained by first creating views from our original database
in SQLite, then using the streamlit library in Python to create a UI and graph the respective data. 

GRAPHS:
1. Graph showing the total purchases made in each month for the past four years (2019-2022)
2. Graph showing the highest rated books in the database

HOW TO RUN: 
Clone github repo, and use the command "python -m streamlit run BooksDatabase.py" to run the program and open the site in your browser. 
Use "python -m streamlit run BookRatingsGraph.py" to run the tool for the Book Ratings Graph
